# Polynomial Efficiency and Power in Deep Networks

This project is an example testing some of the ideas presented in 
Rolnick and Tegmark's paper [The power of deeper networks for expressing natural functions]()
recently published having to do with the power of networks with varying number of layers.  The
central thesis being that deeper networks can take more advantage of nested operations,
as demonstrated by polynomial evaluation.  That is, shallow networks cannot factor whereas deep
networks can.  This is just my own variant on the idea as a means of showing to myself 
how this idea works.
